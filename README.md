# environments

Various development environments using nix flakes and
language specific package managers

.envrc files are provided in two versions:

- eager - simple envrc that just loads environment and
  executes commands
- lazy - loads dump that has to be built manually,
  like [here](https://dev.to/allenap/some-direnv-best-practices-actually-just-one-4864)
